# Turn RPG system
## Kokku Software Engineer Applicant Test
========================================================================

##    This program needs to work with these rules:
- This application is an auto-battle RPG, that has a "grid" with cells/tiles/boxes organized as a matrix.
- This grid provides the length for the x and y-axis.
- There is also a Character with a Name, Health, BaseDamage, DamageMultiplier, current cell/box, target, and an Index.
- Each team should have one move per turn (except when the move places the character in attack range of an opposing team character)
- The game should work with a "battlefield" of any size, including a non-square matrix.
- Make sure all the variables in CHARACTER are engaged in a code feature.
- The game should inform the player when the battle is over and which team has been declared victorious.
- The battlefield should only be reprinted/redrawn if a player makes a move.
- Each character should look for a possible target and attack it when this is viable and if not, move closer into attack range.
- Each candidate must also implement one of the following extra features in the application, to be selected depending on their month of birth.
